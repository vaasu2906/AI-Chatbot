# AI Chatbot

## Project Description

This project is a **web-based AI Chatbot** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, leveraging a **REST API** for intelligent responses. The chatbot allows users to interact in real-time, providing answers, suggestions, or conversational replies based on their input.

The interface is clean and responsive, designed to provide a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The chatbot communicates with an AI-powered backend through a REST API, which processes user queries and returns meaningful responses.
